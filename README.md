# Tumor-Detector
This program is written in Python. It uses the FastAI library. I used a dataset on tumors that are labeled. It can be found on Kaggle.com. It is trained on a CNN using resnet34. This can only determine if there is a tumor in the brain from an MRI scan. The dataset can be downloaded from this link https://www.kaggle.com/sartajbhuvaji/brain-tumor-classification-mri?rvi=1. All this can be learned from the FastAI course. https://course.fast.ai/videos/?lesson=1
